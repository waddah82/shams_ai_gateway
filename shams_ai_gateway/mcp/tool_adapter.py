Tool Adapter for BaseTool Compatibility

Allows existing BaseTool-based tools to work with the new MCP server
without rewriting them. This is a compatibility layer.

def build_tool_dict(tool_instance) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Build the MCP tool dict for a BaseTool instance.

    Returns the same dict shape that ``MCPServer.add_tool`` stores, but without
    touching any server/global state. This lets request handlers register tools
    into a per-request registry, keeping concurrent requests isolated (issue
    #197).

    Args:
        tool_instance: Instance of BaseTool or compatible class

    Returns:
        Dict with keys: name, description, inputSchema, annotations, fn
