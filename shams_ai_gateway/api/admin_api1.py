"""
Admin API facade — re-exports all whitelisted functions from submodules.

This preserves the ``shams_ai_gateway.api.admin_api.<fn>`` method path
used by all frontend ``frappe.call()`` invocations and test imports.

The ``@frappe.whitelist()`` decorator in each submodule registers the
function object when the submodule first executes. Re-importing here gives
the same object, so Frappe's whitelist check passes transparently.
