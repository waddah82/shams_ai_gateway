Raise `code_execution_max_recursion` to 500 on existing sites.

The original default of 100 is too tight for Frappe internals — even a
plain `frappe.get_doc(...)` inside `run_python_code` overflows it and
surfaces as a misleading "Recursion limit exceeded" error.

Follows the ERPNext pattern for Single DocType defaults: set
unconditionally in a one-time patch. Runtime checks cannot reliably
distinguish "admin intentionally set 100" from "never touched — still
on the old default", so we don't try.
