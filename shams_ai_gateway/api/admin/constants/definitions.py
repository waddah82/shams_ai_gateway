print(monthly_sales)

# Visualization with matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
monthly_sales.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Analysis')
plt.show()

# Advanced analysis with numpy
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = np.mean(arr)
print(f"Mean: {{result}}")
