Concurrency regression tests for the MCP server tool registry.

Regression tests for: https://github.com/buildswithpaul/Shams_AI_Gateway/issues/197

Background
----------
The MCP endpoint uses a single module-level ``MCPServer`` instance. The old
request flow cleared and repopulated that instance's shared ``_tool_registry``
on every request:

    mcp._tool_registry.clear()
    register_base_tool(mcp, tool_instance)   # repeated per tool

With concurrent ``tools/call`` requests handled in the same worker, one request
could ``clear()`` the registry while another was validating or executing a tool
against it. Symptoms reported in #197:

  * an in-flight call failing with "Tool '<name>' not found. Available tools:
    [...]" even though the tool exists, and
  * only one of several concurrent executions making it into Assistant Audit
    Log.

The fix (Option A) builds a per-request tool registry on the call stack and
passes it into ``MCPServer.handle()``. No request mutates shared state, so
concurrent requests are isolated.

These tests exercise ``MCPServer.handle()`` directly with mocked Werkzeug
requests, which is the layer where the race lived. The test tool overrides
``log_execution`` to a no-op so tool execution stays entirely in memory — the
threaded test never opens a DB connection and therefore never escapes the test
runner's transaction/rollback boundary.
