## What you get

Once SAG is installed, your team can ask an LLM for things they'd
normally do by hand:

> *"Show me overdue invoices from our top five customers."*
>
> *"Update this lead's status to Qualified and set next action date to
> Monday."*
>
> *"Run the monthly revenue report and summarise the top movers."*
>
> *"How much stock of SKU-1234 do we have across all warehouses?"*

Behind that simple interaction, SAG exposes **24 built-in tools** for
the things your team does every day — document CRUD, search, reports,
workflows, analytics, file extraction, and dashboards. Admins can
publish **Skills** (reusable instructions that teach the LLM how to
handle a specific job) and **Prompt Templates** (saved starting points
users can pick from the admin UI) so answers stay consistent and use
the right reports. The LLM authenticates over **OAuth 2.0** as a real
ERPNext user, so it only sees data that user can already see in the
desk. Every call is recorded in the **Assistant Audit Log**.

It's a Frappe app, so developers can extend the toolset from their own
Frappe apps through a hook — your data model, your business logic,
scoped per your app.

Your data stays in your site. You control which LLM connects.

---

## Quick start

Two install paths depending on how you run Frappe.

### On Frappe Cloud (recommended)

1. Go to your site's **Apps** tab in the Frappe Cloud dashboard.
2. Find **Shams AI Gateway** in the marketplace and click **Install**.
3. Frappe Cloud installs and migrates the app for you.

Marketplace: <https://cloud.frappe.io/marketplace/apps/shams_ai_gateway>

### On self-hosted bench

```bash
cd frappe-bench
bench get-app https://github.com/buildswithpaul/Shams_AI_Gateway
bench --site <your-site> install-app shams_ai_gateway
```

### Connect your LLM

Once installed, the same four steps work for any MCP-compatible client.
Example shown for Claude Desktop:

1. Go to **Desk → SAG Admin** and copy the **MCP Endpoint URL**.
2. In **Claude Desktop → Settings → Connectors → Add Custom Connector**,
   paste the URL and click **Add**.
3. Click **Connect**, log in with your ERPNext account, and authorize.
4. Ask Claude something — for example, *"List all customers created this
   month."*

For ChatGPT, Claude Web, and MCP Inspector walkthroughs, see the
[Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Skills and Prompt Templates

SAG gives you two ways to shape what the LLM does with your data.

**Skills** are reusable instructions you give the LLM — stored as
`SAG Skill` documents inside your site. Each skill has a `skill_id`,
a description, and markdown content describing how to handle a specific
task using the available tools. The LLM lists skills on connect and
pulls them on demand, so every time someone asks about, say, the
monthly sales close, the answer is consistent and uses the right
reports.

**Prompt Templates** are saved starting points for the *user's* side
of the conversation — Jinja-templated prompts with typed arguments
(dropdowns, dates, booleans). Authors publish them from the admin page;
users pick one, fill in the arguments, and the rendered prompt is sent
to the LLM. Use them for frequently-asked analyses like "Sales
Analysis", "Manufacturing Analysis", or your own industry-specific
workflows.

Both live in Frappe, so they're version-controlled with your site,
shareable across users, and can be shipped by external Frappe apps
through the `assistant_skills` hook.

---

## Tools at a glance

SAG ships 24 tools across four plugins: **Core** (Frappe operations),
**Data Science** (Python execution, analytics, file extraction),
**Visualization** (dashboards and charts), and **Custom Tools** (the
registry for tools contributed by external apps).

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Documents | `get_document`, `list_documents`, `create_document`, `update_document`, `delete_document`, `submit_document` |
| Search | `search`, `search_documents`, `search_doctype`, `search_link`, `fetch` |
| Reports | `report_list`, `report_requirements`, `generate_report` |
| Approvals | `get_pending_approvals`, `run_workflow` |
| Schema | `get_doctype_info` |
| Analytics | `run_python_code`, `run_database_query`, `analyze_business_data` |
| Files | `extract_file_content` |
| Dashboards | `create_dashboard`, `create_dashboard_chart`, `list_user_dashboards` |

Full specification for each tool is in the
[Tool Reference](docs/api/TOOL_REFERENCE.md).

---

## Extend with your own tools

If you have a Frappe app and want the LLM to reach into it, use the
`assistant_tools` hook in your app's `hooks.py`. This is the recommended
path — tools travel with the app, survive upgrades, and stay scoped to
your data model. The same pattern works for Skills via the
`assistant_skills` hook.

If you need to modify core SAG behaviour instead, write an internal
plugin.

See the [External App Development guide](docs/development/EXTERNAL_APP_DEVELOPMENT.md)
for the hook contract, and the
[Plugin Development guide](docs/development/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md) for
internal plugins.

---

## Authentication & security

SAG uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for LLM connections — the LLM never sees
the user's Frappe password. Every tool call is scoped to the calling
user's Frappe and ERPNext roles and permissions: if the user cannot
read a DocType in the desk, they cannot read it through the LLM either.
Every call is logged to `Assistant Audit Log` with caller, tool,
arguments, and result status, so admins always have a full record of
what the LLM did.
