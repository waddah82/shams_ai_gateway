{
  "mcpServers": {
    "frappe-assistant": {
      "url": "https://your-site.com/api/method/shams_ai_gateway.api.sag_endpoint.handle_mcp",
      "transport": "streamablehttp",
      "oauth": {
        "discoveryUrl": "https://your-site.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
        "clientName": "Claude Desktop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace `your-site.com` with your actual Frappe site URL.**

#### 3. Authorize Claude Desktop (if not done in UI)

1. **Restart Claude Desktop**
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **When prompted**, Claude will open your browser
4. **Login to Frappe** and authorize Claude Desktop
5. **Return to Claude Desktop** - you're connected!

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Claude discovers your OAuth configuration automatically
- Registers as an OAuth client (if dynamic registration enabled)
- Requests your authorization
- Stores and manages access tokens
- Automatically refreshes tokens when they expire

   - **Transport**: `StreamableHTTP` or `HTTP`
   - **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-site.com/api/method/shams_ai_gateway.api.sag_endpoint.handle_mcp`
   - **Authentication**: Select `OAuth 2.0`
   - **OAuth Discovery URL**: `https://your-site.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
6. **Save** and **Authorize** when prompted

**Replace `your-site.com` with your actual Frappe site URL.**

> 💡 **Note**: ChatGPT's MCP support may vary by subscription tier. Custom actions are typically available for ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users.

#### 3. Test the Connection

Once authorized, you can use ChatGPT to interact with your Frappe data:

- "List my customers in Frappe"
- "Create a sales order for customer ABC"
- "Show me this month's sales report"

**[📖 See ChatGPT integration details](../integrations/CHATGPT_INTEGRATION.md)** *(coming soon)*

### Option D: Custom Application Integration

For custom applications or other MCP clients, see the complete OAuth integration example in our [MCP StreamableHTTP Guide](../architecture/MCP_STREAMABLEHTTP_GUIDE.md#option-3-custom-application-integration).

**Quick Example:**

```python
import requests

# 1. Discover OAuth endpoints
config = requests.get(
    "https://your-site.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
).json()

# 2. Perform OAuth flow (see full example in guide)
# ... authorization code flow with PKCE ...

# 3. Make authenticated MCP requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    config["mcp_endpoint"],
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "tools/list",
        "params": {},
        "id": 1
    }
)
print(response.json())
```

If you're upgrading from an older version that used the STDIO bridge, see our [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## 🎉 Step 4: Test Your Setup

### Basic Test Commands

Once connected, try these commands with your AI:

#### 1. Check Connection
> "Can you connect to my ERPNext system? Show me the server status."

#### 2. Simple Document Query
> "How many customers do I have in the system?"

#### 3. Create a Test Document
> "Create a test customer called 'AI Test Customer' with email 'test@ai.com'"

#### 4. Data Analysis
> "Show me a summary of sales invoices from this month"

### Expected Responses

If everything is working, you should see:

✅ **Connection Successful**: AI responds with system information  
✅ **Data Access**: AI can read your ERPNext data  
✅ **Document Creation**: AI can create and modify documents  
✅ **Analysis Capabilities**: AI can analyze and report on your data  

## 📄 Step 5: Configure OCR (Optional)

Shams AI Gateway includes built-in OCR for extracting text from scanned documents and images. Two backends are available:

### Option A: PaddleOCR (Default - No Extra Setup)

PaddleOCR works out of the box. It runs locally and supports 80+ languages. No configuration needed — it's the default backend.

### Option B: Ollama Vision (AI-Powered OCR)

For better document understanding and complex layouts, you can use an Ollama vision model:

#### 1. Install Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (Linux)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull a vision model for OCR
ollama pull deepseek-ocr
```

#### 2. Configure in Shams AI Gateway Settings

1. **Login to ERPNext** as Administrator
2. **Go to**: Setup → Integrations → Shams AI Gateway Settings
3. **OCR Tab:**
   - **OCR Backend**: Select `ollama`
   - **Ollama API URL**: `http://localhost:11434` (default)
   - **Ollama Vision Model**: `deepseek-ocr:latest`
   - **Request Timeout**: `120` seconds
4. **Save**

#### 3. Test OCR

Try extracting text from a scanned document:

> "Extract the text from the uploaded invoice PDF"
> "OCR this scanned document image"

**How it works**: When Ollama is selected, the system sends document images to the Ollama vision model for text extraction. If Ollama fails or returns empty results, it automatically falls back to PaddleOCR.

### OCR Language Support

Set the default OCR language in Shams AI Gateway Settings. Common language codes:
- `en` - English (default)
- `fr` - French
- `de` - German
- `es` - Spanish
- `ch` - Chinese (Simplified)
- `japan` - Japanese

You can also specify the language per-request when calling the `extract_file_content` tool.
